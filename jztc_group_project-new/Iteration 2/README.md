## Group Reflection
### Key learnings: 
- We learnt how to create a Gantt Chart on Microsoft Excel.
- We learnt how to make GitHub Repositories, and how to invite collaborators to work on them as a team.
- We learnt how to improve our efforts to communicate effectively between team members. While we have improvements to make; we have made progress. 
### Challenges faced: 
- Communication Hurdles: Despite efforts to maintain regular communication channels, there were instances where messages were not relayed effectively, leading to confusion regarding task assignments and deadlines.
- Technical Difficulties: Some team members encountered technical issues with accessing or using certain software tools essential for project management and collaboration, which hindered progress on certain tasks.
- Time Management: Balancing individual responsibilities with group commitments proved challenging for some members, resulting in delays in task completion and project milestones.

### Achievements: 
- Establishment of Communication Protocols: Despite the communication challenges faced, the team successfully established clearer communication protocols, including designated meeting times and preferred communication channels, to enhance collaboration and information sharing.
- Effective Task Delegation: Through the efforts of the Project Manager and active participation from team members, tasks were delegated efficiently, ensuring a fair distribution of workload and timely progress on project deliverables.
- Creation of Comprehensive Project Documentation: The development of a detailed Gantt chart by Tainui and a resource chart by Cairo provided the team with valuable visual aids for project planning and resource allocation, contributing to improved project organisation and management.

### Plans on improvement for Iteration 2:
- Enhanced Communication Strategies: Implementing additional communication strategies such as regular progress updates, status reports, and more frequent check-ins to address any emerging issues or concerns promptly.
- Technical Proficiency Development: Providing support and resources for team members to improve their technical skills and familiarity with project management tools, ensuring smoother collaboration and reduced reliance on external assistance for technical issues.
- Refinement of Time Management Practices: Implementing time-tracking tools or techniques to monitor individual and collective time management more effectively, identifying areas for improvement and adjusting project timelines accordingly.
