# Progress Report
### This progress report serves as a comprehensive overview of our group's activities and reflections during Iteration 3 for Team JZTC..

## Group Members
- Joenella Hiko
- Zoe Proudfoot
- Tainui Weti
- Cairo Bullen

## Group Reflection
### Key learnings: 
- We learned  markdown language 
- We learned how to improve our efforts to collaborate work on our Google Drive and GitHub. 

### Challenges faced: 
- Workflow management: The local file storage needed to be more organised as we were losing track of data. We have had to create a new repository to reorganise. 
- Time Management: Team members needed help balancing the workload. It has been challenging to complete group tasks when members are absent, putting the project at high risk. 

### Achievements:
- We produced a risk register and matrix for the project
- Documentation for Group Meeting Report for Iteration 3
- Collaborating and uploading documentation onto GitHub 
- User Acceptance Test 

### Plans on improvement for Iteration 2:
- Sharing Ideas and Collaborating more often: Team members/Stakeholders must be present at daily meetings to be able to discuss and resolve any issues that can be addressed to achieve a better outcome.
